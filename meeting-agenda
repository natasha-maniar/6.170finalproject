achieved & missed milestones from your project plan
- created concept diagrams for key concepts 
- solidified motivation/purpose of app 

any difficulties that you encountered 
- how to deal with important legal documents (security/submission) 
- how to prioritize what to build (schedule of implementation) 
- chat implementation (how to create a simple UI with outbound, inbound messages without being too complicated) 
- can we use outside packages? 
- how to link application to your curated listings (what information should be extracted and when) 
- short term or long term rentals? 

any changes made to your design or project plan
- distinguishing different users (admin, user, government) in our concept sketches (should we keep admin and government the same?)
